# What Adrian is doing now

_Last updated: June 21st, 2017._

This page is accessible from [here](https://github.com/ThinkADRIAN/public/blob/master/README.md), and was inspired by [this post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Here's what I'm doing now:

* Living in Brooklyn, NY, with Kayo, Kai, Anthony, JP, and Alyssa.
* Working at [Blue Mesa Health](https://www.bluemesahealth.com/) as Director of User Experience.
* Available for consulting work at [The Start Code](https://thestartcode.com/).
* Helping Kayo keep [BK Sensei](http://bksensei.com/) up and running.
